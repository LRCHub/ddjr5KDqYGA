I don't know what to say
So I'll say nothing that's ok
I don't know what to do
So I'll stand green eyes black skin in front of you
Chariot will take me down
To the curious part of town.
In the ocean, I'm in motion
My eyes full of devotion.
What were you like in Norway
Not you but the first one down the hallway
Open blue eyed dull mind
Graceful golden constantly
Northern light upon my bed
From the window I descend.
In the ocean, it was spoken
My eyes full of devotion.
I think about you now and then
But it's just a moment and I forget again
In fact the last time I thought of you
I was three-fourths the way into a friend
Up on the roof I see you now
Still don't know what you were on about.
In the ocean, no emotion
That's the sound of devotion.
