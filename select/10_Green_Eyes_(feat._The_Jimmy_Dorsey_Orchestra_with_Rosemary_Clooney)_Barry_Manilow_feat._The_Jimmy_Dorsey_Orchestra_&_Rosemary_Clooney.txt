Your green eyes with their soft light
Your eyes that promise sweet nights
Bring to my soul a longing
Of thirst for love's devine
In dreams I seem to hold you
To find you and enfold you
Our lips meet and our hearts too
With a thrill so sublime
Those cool and limbit green eyes
A pool where in my love lies
So deep that in my searching
For happiness I feel
That they will ever haunt me
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me
Green eyes
Make my dream come true
Green eyes with their soft lights
And eyes that promise sweet nights
Bring to my soul a longing
A thirst for love devine
In dreams I seem to hold you
To find you and enfold you
Our lips meet and our hearts too
With a thrill so sublime
Those cool and limbit green eyes
A pool where in my love lies
So deep that in my searching
For happiness I feel
That they will ever haunt me
All through my life they'll taunt me
But will they ever want me
Green eyes
Make my dream come true
