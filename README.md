[00:10.74] Summer in my eyelids, eatin' rice and beans
[00:16.30] Paintin' Kaia's bedroom, think she wanted green
[00:21.70] But the weather puts you on my mind
[00:24.40] Dragonfruit and peaches in the wine
[00:27.16] Kissin' circles underneath your eyes
[00:45.16] 
[00:30.67] Of course I know why we lasted two months
[00:36.44] Could not hold my hand in public
[00:40.85] Felt their eyes judgin' our love and beggin' for blood
[00:47.45] I could never blame you darlin' (oh, oh, oh, oh)
[01:11.45] 
[00:56.72] Some of these folks wanna make you cry
[01:02.27] But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide
[01:07.69] And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:27.69] 
[01:15.90] I wish that your parents had been kinder to you
[01:21.25] They made you hate what you were out of habit
[01:26.71] Remember when they caught us makin' out after school
[01:32.27] Your dad said he'd felt like he lost you
[01:52.27] 
[01:36.66] So I know why we lasted two months
[01:41.88] Could not hold my hand in public
[01:46.17] Felt their eyes judgin' our love and beggin' for blood
[01:52.74] I could never blame you darlin' (oh, oh, oh, oh)
[02:16.74] 
[02:01.40] Some of these folks wanna make you cry (oh, oh)
[02:07.84] But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide
[02:12.90] And shine, and shi-ine, yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:32.90] 
[02:22.53] Some of these folks wanna make you cry (oh, oh)
[02:29.54] But you gotta trust how you feel insi-i-i-ide (oh, oh, oh)
[02:34.64] And shine (oh, oh), and shi-ine (oh, oh), yeah, yeah, yeah
[03:03.64] 
[02:41.74] Doo, doo, doo, doo
[02:47.32] Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo-doo
[02:52.97] Doo, doo, doo, doo
[02:58.18] Doo, doo, doo, doo-doo
